Shortcut: Implement Execution Plan

Instructions:

Create a to-do list with the following items then perform all of them:

1. Review the execution plan and confirm scope, assumptions, and inputs. If anything
   is unclear, ask for clarification.

2. Create a new branch for this work (name it based on the plan or task).

3. Implement the plan step-by-step, adding or updating tests as needed.

4. Run the relevant tests per @docs/development.md and ensure all tests pass.

5. Follow @shortcut:precommit-process.md to review changes and run pre-commit checks.

6. Commit the changes with a concise, descriptive commit message.

7. Push the branch and open a new PR (use `gh` if available; see
   @docs/general/agent-setup/github-cli-setup.md if needed).
