# Task Completion Notifier Skill

A generic agent skill that sends desktop notifications when tasks are complete using terminal-notifier.

## Overview

This skill enables an agent to notify you via desktop notifications when a job is finalized, needs input, or ends in errors. By default, all jobs assigned to the agent trigger one notification at final handoff unless you say otherwise.

## Installation

This skill requires `terminal-notifier` to be installed on macOS:

```bash
brew install terminal-notifier
```

Verify installation:
```bash
which terminal-notifier
```

## Usage

The skill is automatically invoked when:

1. You explicitly ask to be notified ("notify me when done")
2. The agent completes a long-running task
3. The agent needs your input to proceed
4. The agent encounters errors that block progress

### Automatic Behavior

By default, assume all jobs will generate exactly one notification. The agent should send it only after the work is fully finalized and immediately before the final user-facing report.

### Timing Rule

Use this skill only at the very end of the job unless the user explicitly asks for different timing.

Order:

1. Finish the work
2. Verify and finalize the outcome
3. Send the notification
4. Deliver the final report

### Notification Format

```bash
terminal-notifier -title "{JOB_DESCRIPTION}" -message "{STATUS}"
```

**Status values:**
- `completed` - Task finished successfully
- `needs_input` - Task requires user input
- `errors` - Task encountered errors

## Examples

### Request with Explicit Notification

```
User: "Implement the user dashboard and notify me when you're done"
```

The agent will complete the work, finalize the result, send the notification, and then deliver the final report:
```bash
terminal-notifier -title "User Dashboard Implementation" -message "completed"
```

### Long-Running Task (Automatic Notification)

```
User: "Run the full test suite and fix any failures"
```

The agent will execute tests, attempt fixes, finalize the outcome, send the notification, and then deliver the final report:
```bash
terminal-notifier -title "Test Suite and Fixes" -message "completed"
```

### Needs Input

```
User: "Set up authentication"
```

If the agent needs to choose between OAuth or JWT, it first confirms it is blocked, then sends:
```bash
terminal-notifier -title "Authentication Setup" -message "needs_input"
```

### Encountered Errors

```
User: "Deploy to production"
```

If deployment fails and the agent has reached a finalized error state:
```bash
terminal-notifier -title "Production Deployment" -message "errors"
```

## Features

- **Automatic notifications** - Default behavior for all jobs unless disabled
- **Clear status indicators** - completed, needs_input, or errors
- **Concise titles** - Understand what finished at a glance
- **Final-handoff timing** - Sent only after work is finalized and right before the final report
- **No spam** - One notification per task, not per step

## Configuration

No configuration needed. The skill is ready to use once terminal-notifier is installed.

## Disabling Notifications

If you don't want notifications for a specific task, tell the agent:

```
User: "Run tests but don't notify me"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Notification not appearing

1. Check terminal-notifier is installed: `which terminal-notifier`
2. Test manually: `terminal-notifier -title "Test" -message "Hello"`
3. Check macOS notification settings for Terminal

### Permission issues

Ensure Terminal has notification permissions:
1. System Preferences → Notifications
2. Find Terminal (or your terminal app)
3. Enable "Allow Notifications"
