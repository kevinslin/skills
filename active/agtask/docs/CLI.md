# agtask CLI reference

`agtask` manages Codex task metadata and lifecycle history in a local SQLite
ledger. The installed executable is a Python script:

```bash
AGTASK="$HOME/.codex/skills/agtask/scripts/agtask"
python3 "$AGTASK" <command> [flags]
```

Unless `AGTASK_DB` is set, commands use
`$HOME/.llm/agtask/ledger.db`. Direct commands report errors and exit nonzero;
the `hook` adapter deliberately fails open so bookkeeping cannot interrupt a
Codex session.

## Global flags

These shared flags are defined here once and are not repeated under each
command:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help. Place it before the command for the command list or after a command for that command's flags. |
| `--json` | Emit machine-readable, indented JSON. Place it after the command. It is available on every command except `hook`. For `dashboard`, it returns one snapshot instead of starting the local server and cannot be combined with `--no-open`. |

## Shared concepts

- `<creation-id>` is the canonical UUIDv4 generated before task creation and
  stored as logical `thread.id`.
- `<session-id>` is the real Codex session ID stored as unique
  `thread.session_id` and used for hooks, app actions, and deep links.
- Thread status is one of `todo`, `active`, `blocked`, `merging`, or `done`.
- Thread kind is `main` for a root dispatcher or `child` for a task with a
  `parent_session_id`.
- Structured thread results include a `rollouts` array ordered newest first.
  Each rollout contains `id`, `created`, `thread_id`, `turn_id`, `role`, and
  `message`.
- Without `--json`, thread results label the logical identifier as `Task ID`,
  the Codex identifier as `Session ID`, and lineage as `Parent session ID`.
  A missing parent or unavailable logical ID is shown as an em dash.
- Every direct command loads `$HOME/.agtask.json` and then `./.agtask.json`.
  See [Configuration and prompt hooks](../README.md#configuration-and-prompt-hooks).
- `AGTASK_DB` overrides the ledger path. `AGTASK_HOOKS_FILE` overrides the
  Codex hooks file used by `install-hooks` and `uninstall-hooks`.

## `resolve-create`

Resolve creation settings from built-in defaults, configuration files, and
explicit flags. This command does not create or open the ledger. It returns the
resolved execution environment and any configured `OnCreate` entry in
`hook_prompts`.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" resolve-create \
  --mode fork --kind child --project agtask --title agtask/bootstrap-title \
  --parent-session-id 019f-parent \
  --worktree true --model gpt-5.6-sol --nopin --json
```

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--mode <mode>` | `clean` or `fork`. Built-in default: `clean`. |
| `--kind <kind>` | `main` or `child`. Built-in default: `child`. |
| `--project <name>` | Non-empty project name without surrounding whitespace. Built-in default: current directory name. |
| `--parent-session-id <id>` | Required for child creation and forbidden for main creation. Embedded as immutable Codex-session lineage in the version-2 child trailer. |
| `--title <text>` | Required non-empty one-line resolved title without surrounding whitespace. |
| `--worktree <boolean>` | `true` or `false`. Built-in default: `false`. |
| `--model <name>` | Non-empty model name, or `inherit` to omit an explicit model. Built-in default: `inherit`. |
| `--pin <boolean>` | `true` or `false`. Built-in default: `true`. |
| `--nopin` | Shorthand for `--pin false`. |

Creation flags are repeatable so orchestration layers can combine inputs safely.
Repeating the same value is accepted; supplying conflicting values is an error.
Explicit flags override `./.agtask.json`, which overrides
`$HOME/.agtask.json`, which overrides built-in defaults.

The result contains a newly generated canonical UUIDv4 `id`, plus `mode`,
`kind`, `project`, `title`, `worktree`, `model`, `pin`,
`bootstrap_args`, `bootstrap_trailer`, `environment`, `include_model`, and
`hook_prompts`. `bootstrap_args` is the typed machine value and
`bootstrap_trailer` is its canonical versioned envelope for byte-identical use
as the final child-prompt block. Environment type is
`worktree` when `worktree=true`, `same-directory` for a fork without a
worktree, and `local` otherwise.

## `init`

When absent, create `$HOME/.agtask.json` with mode `0600`, the bundled default
`OnPreClose` Git-finalization prompt, and disabled `OnCreate` and `OnPostClose`
prompts. Preserve an existing global configuration unchanged. Then create the
schema-v5 ledger when it does not exist, initialize an empty version-zero
SQLite file, or validate an existing current ledger.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" init --json
```

There are no command-specific flags. The command returns the global
configuration path, whether it was created, the resolved database
path, and the schema version. It refuses incompatible schemas rather than migrating
them, creates the store directory with mode `0700`, and repairs ledger file
permissions to `0600`.

## `config`

Inspect the merged configuration without opening the ledger.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" config --json
```

There are no command-specific flags. The result contains:

- `defaults`: the merged creation defaults;
- `hooks`: the merged `OnCreate`, `OnPreClose`, and `OnPostClose` prompt configuration;
- `sources`: existing files that were loaded, in merge order;
- `precedence`: the deterministic home-then-project paths, including missing
  paths.

Malformed JSON, unknown keys, or invalid values produce an error that names the
offending configuration path.

## `add`

Register an existing current Codex task without creating, forking, renaming, or
pinning it:

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" add agtask \
  --session-id <current-session-id> \
  --title "Preserve this Codex title" \
  --initial-prompt $'Implement the requested workflow.\nKeep the API small.' \
  --json
```

| Argument or flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `<project>` | Required positional project label. It must be nonempty and have no surrounding whitespace. |
| `--session-id <session-id>` | Required real ID of the current Codex task. It must be nonempty and have no surrounding whitespace. |
| `--title <text>` | Required current Codex app title. It must be nonempty, one line, and have no surrounding whitespace. |
| `--initial-prompt <text>` | Required exact oldest user prompt, which the skill obtains by paging the current task's history. Its normalized value becomes the immutable description. |

For a new session, the command generates a canonical UUIDv4 logical `id` inside
the write transaction, inserts an active `main` row with null
`parent_session_id`, appends one `thread.created` meta rollout, and returns
configured `OnCreate` prompt data. On a retry, it resolves the row by
`session_id`, reuses the existing logical ID, and verifies exact main kind,
project, title, and normalized description without changing lifecycle state or
history. A session already bound to a child row, or any metadata conflict, is
rejected. Successful output uses the same lifecycle-result shape as
`register`; exact retries return an empty `hook_prompts` array.

## `register`

Create a tracked thread from its initial creation prompt, or verify an exact
existing identity/metadata pair without changing its lifecycle state, title,
or description.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" register \
  --id <creation-id> \
  --session-id <session-id> \
  --parent-session-id <parent-session-id> \
  --kind child \
  --project agtask \
  --title "Document the CLI" \
  --initial-prompt $'Task:\nAdd a complete CLI reference.' \
  --description "Add a complete CLI reference." \
  --status todo \
  --json
```

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--id <creation-id>` | Required logical creation ID; must be canonical UUIDv4. |
| `--session-id <session-id>` | Required real Codex session ID. It is unique across tracked tasks. |
| `--parent-session-id <session-id>` | Required for `child`; forbidden for `main`. It may identify an untracked parent but cannot equal the child session. |
| `--kind <kind>` | Required: `main` or `child`. |
| `--project <name>` | Required non-empty project name without surrounding whitespace. |
| `--title <text>` | Required task title. |
| `--initial-prompt <text>` | Required when creating a thread. The CLI normalizes this prompt and stores the result as the immutable task description. |
| `--description <text>` | Optional compatibility assertion. When supplied, its normalized value must equal the normalized initial prompt and, on retries, the stored description. It is never an update value. |
| `--status <status>` | Initial status for a new row: `todo` or `active`. On an exact existing-row retry, it is accepted for request compatibility but does not change lifecycle state. Default: `active`. |
| `--authoritative-session` | One-shot child creation only. Treat the supplied session returned by `create_thread` as canonical and reconcile an earlier provisional copied-helper binding for the same logical ID. Requires `--kind child`, `--initial-prompt`, and `--status active`. |

The command initializes the ledger if needed. A new row receives a
`thread.created` meta rollout and returns configured `OnCreate` prompt data.
The initial prompt is the sole source of the stored description. If both prompt
and description are supplied, a mismatch is rejected before insertion. Retrying
registration with the same `(id, session_id)` pair is idempotent: `kind`,
`project`, parent lineage, title, and description must match the stored row,
and its current status is preserved. Ordinary registration rejects an ID bound
to another session or a session bound to another ID.

With `--authoritative-session`, a different stored session may be displaced
only when the requested session is unclaimed, immutable parent/kind/project/title
metadata matches, and the existing active row has the provisional first-turn
shape: one `thread.created` event, one user rollout, and no other metadata.
The transaction removes copied helper user/assistant rollouts, rebinds
`session_id`, replaces the description with the real prompt-derived value, and
returns `session_rebound_from`. All other identity conflicts remain errors.
For compatibility with already-tracked rows, a retry may omit
`--initial-prompt` and assert the exact stored description with `--description`.
A retry returns an empty `hook_prompts` array. A `done` thread must be explicitly
reopened before registration can update it. Reconciliation preserves a live
`merging` state so it cannot orphan the project claim.

Except for current-task `rename`, every other explicit thread-targeting command
below requires exactly one selector: `--id <creation-id>` or
`--session-id <session-id>`. Both resolve to the same row; persisted rollout
and merge-claim ownership always use the logical creation ID. Rename requires
the real `--session-id` so its returned app action cannot be confused with the
logical ledger ID. Hooks do not use this selector surface and always resolve
their payload `session_id` through `thread.session_id`.

## `show`

Return one thread and all of its rollouts, newest first.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" show --session-id <session-id> --json
```

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--id <creation-id>` / `--session-id <session-id>` | Mutually exclusive selector; exactly one is required. |

The command fails if the ledger or thread does not exist.
The JSON thread object exposes both `id` and `session_id`, plus
`parent_session_id`; nested rollout `thread_id` remains the logical ID.

## `rename`

Plan a current-task rename without modifying SQLite:

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" rename \
  --session-id <session-id> \
  --title "Document the complete CLI" \
  --json
```

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--session-id <session-id>` | Required current Codex session. Rename intentionally does not accept logical `--id`. |
| `--title <text>` | Required new title. It must be nonempty, one line, and contain no surrounding whitespace. |
| `--apply <plan-token>` | Apply the exact previously returned plan after its Codex app action succeeds. Omit for read-only planning. |

Planning returns `phase: "app_action_required"`, `plan_version: 2`,
`applied: false`, logical `id`, real `session_id`, `current_title`,
`requested_title`, current `updated`, a deterministic SHA-256 `plan_token`, and
the exact action:

```json
{
  "tool": "codex_app__set_thread_title",
  "arguments": {
    "threadId": "<session-id>",
    "title": "<requested-title>"
  }
}
```

The token binds version, logical ID, session ID, current title, and requested
title. The returned `updated` value is informational; routine rollout activity
does not invalidate the plan. Planning is read-only even when current and
requested titles differ.

Only after the app action succeeds should orchestration invoke:

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" rename \
  --session-id <session-id> \
  --title "Document the complete CLI" \
  --apply <plan-token> \
  --json
```

Apply begins an immediate transaction, re-reads the row, and recomputes the
token before writing. A competing title change or different requested title
rejects the command without writes. A real
rename changes `title`, advances `updated`, appends one `title:renamed` meta
rollout with the same timestamp, and lets the existing FTS update trigger
refresh title search. A same-title plan still emits the idempotent app action;
its accepted apply returns `changed: false` without changing timestamp or
history.

The CLI never calls the Codex app. The `$agtask rename <new-title>` skill
workflow executes the returned action, then applies its token. If apply fails,
that workflow re-reads the row and restores the Codex title to the ledger's
current title. It falls back to the planned `current_title` only when the row
cannot be re-read, and explicitly reports divergence if compensation also
fails.

## `list`

List threads ordered by most recently updated, then most recently created.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" list --status active --limit 25 --json
```

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--status <status>` | Optional filter: `todo`, `active`, `blocked`, `merging`, or `done`. |
| `--limit <integer>` | Maximum rows returned. Default: `50`. |

The result is an array of thread rows without nested rollouts.

## `search`

Run a literal full-text search over the indexed thread title and description.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" search "configuration hooks" --limit 10 --json
```

| Argument or flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `<query>` | Required positional search text. It is escaped and submitted as a literal FTS phrase. |
| `--limit <integer>` | Maximum rows returned. Default: `20`. |

Results are ordered by FTS rank and then most recently updated. Each row
includes its numeric `rank` and does not include nested rollouts.

## `dashboard`

Build a local dashboard view. Without `--json`, the command starts a local
HTTP server on `127.0.0.1`, prints a capability URL, opens it in the default
browser, and runs until interrupted. With `--json`, it returns one snapshot and
does not start a server.

Hover a task row and press `s` to open its status picker. Todo, Active, and
Blocked use the same atomic transition contract as the `status` command. The
request includes the row's expected status, so a concurrent hook or workflow
change returns a conflict instead of being overwritten; refresh and retry.
Merging and Done remain unavailable because close, release, and reopen own
those transitions.

In the browser, each task row opens a token-scoped detail page. The page shows
the task description, rollout items ordered newest first, and properties for
created time, updated time, and session ID. The session ID is a Codex task deep
link. Clicking outside a row's title opens its detail page; the title remains a
Codex task deep link and supports Enter and Space keyboard activation while
preserving native table semantics.
Dashboard detail routes and every `codex://threads/...` link are keyed by
encoded session ID, never by logical creation ID. Snapshot rows expose both
identities and parent-session facets use `parent_session_id`.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" dashboard \
  --project agtask --status active --status blocked \
  --sort updated --direction desc
```

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--project <name>` | Filter by project. Repeat to select multiple projects. |
| `--parent-session-id <session-id>` | Filter by parent session. Repeat to select multiple parents. |
| `--root-parent` | Include threads whose `parent_session_id` is null. |
| `--status <status>` | Filter by `todo`, `active`, `blocked`, `merging`, or `done`. Repeat to select multiple statuses. |
| `--sort <field>` | Sort by `created`, `updated`, or `closed`. Default: `updated`. |
| `--direction <direction>` | `asc` or `desc`. Default: `desc`. |
| `--search <text>` | Case-insensitive title search. Default: empty. |
| `--no-open` | Start the server and print its URL without opening a browser. Cannot be combined with `--json`. |

Repeated values are ORed within a filter dimension; different dimensions are
combined. The JSON snapshot contains active filters, global facets, counts, and
status-grouped thread rows. Dashboard reads never mutate the ledger. The
browser's token-scoped status endpoint is the only dashboard write surface.

## `status`

Set a tracked, nonterminal thread to a nonterminal status.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" status --id <creation-id> --status blocked --json
```

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--id <creation-id>` / `--session-id <session-id>` | Mutually exclusive selector; exactly one is required. |
| `--status <status>` | Required target: `todo`, `active`, or `blocked`. |

A real change updates `updated`, clears `closed`, and appends a
`status:<old>-><new>` meta rollout. Repeating the current status is a no-op.
Use `reopen` rather than `status` for a `done` thread, and use `close` to enter
`done`. A `merging` thread rejects explicit status changes until its claim is
cancelled or committed.

## `reopen`

Move a completed thread back to `active`.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" reopen --session-id <session-id> --json
```

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--id <creation-id>` / `--session-id <session-id>` | Mutually exclusive selector; exactly one is required. |

For a `done` thread, the command clears `closed`, updates `updated`, and appends
`status:done->active`. Reopening a thread that is not done is an idempotent
no-op.

## `audit`

Reconcile active ledger rows with archive state observed through Codex app APIs.
The command is deliberately split into discovery, planning, and confirmed apply
because the CLI cannot and does not call model-mediated Codex APIs.

Discovery returns exact lookup requests for every `active` task and never
mutates:

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" audit --json
```

The orchestration layer resolves each requested `session_id` and supplies a
strict version-1 observation document. Supported states are `archived`,
`not_archived`, `missing`, and `error`; an error requires a nonempty `detail`.
Missing, omitted, and failed lookups are reported in `unresolved` and are never
archive candidates.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" audit \
  --observations-json \
  '{"schema_version":1,"sessions":[{"session_id":"<session-id>","state":"archived"}]}' \
  --json
```

If any active task has a positive `archived` observation, the result has
`phase: "confirmation_required"`, lists the exact `affected_tasks`, and returns
a deterministic `plan_token`; no state has changed. The caller must show that
set and obtain explicit user confirmation. Declining, omitting, or being unable
to obtain confirmation ends the workflow without another command.

Only after confirmation may the caller refresh every Codex lookup and submit
the fresh observations with the returned token:

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" audit \
  --observations-json '<fresh-observation-document>' \
  --apply <plan-token> \
  --json
```

The apply phase begins an immediate SQLite transaction, rebuilds the candidate
set, and rejects a stale or mismatched token before writing. A refreshed result
that no longer contains archive candidates is a read-only no-op. Each
still-active candidate moves to the existing terminal `done` state, receives one shared
`closed`/`updated` timestamp, and appends `status:active->done` followed by
`archival:codex-thread-archived`. It does not acquire a merge claim or surface
close hooks because it reconciles a Codex thread that is already archived.
Tasks in any non-active status are ignored. Re-running discovery or planning is
read-only, and re-running after a successful apply finds no matching active
candidate.

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--observations-json <json>` | Optional strict observation document. Omit for discovery. |
| `--apply <plan-token>` | Apply the unchanged affected set after explicit user confirmation. Requires observations. |
| `--json` | Emit the structured protocol result. Human output lists lookup requests, affected tasks, and unresolved sessions. |

Codex lookup requests always use `thread.session_id`; affected rows retain their
logical `thread.id`. Observations for sessions that are no longer active are
returned in `ignored_observations`, which makes a repeated audit safe without
silently reclassifying another task.

## `close`

Prepare or complete a tracked thread. Preparation atomically attempts an exact
project-scoped lease. A successful claim changes the thread to `merging` and
returns a fencing token plus configured `OnPreClose`; contention returns a
randomized retry hint, no prompt, and no state change:

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" close --session-id <session-id> --if-tracked --prepare --json
```

After orchestration heartbeats the lease and successfully consumes every
returned prompt, the committing close atomically sets `status=done`, sets
`closed` and `updated` to the same timestamp, and appends
`status:merging->done` plus `finalization:completed` meta rollouts. After the
transaction commits, the result surfaces configured `OnPostClose` prompt data for
the Codex orchestration layer; the CLI does not execute or persist the prompt.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" close --session-id <session-id> --if-tracked \
  --merge-token <token> --json
```

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--id <creation-id>` / `--session-id <session-id>` | Mutually exclusive selector; exactly one is required. |
| `--if-tracked` | Treat an absent ledger or unknown selector as a successful no-op, returning `status: "untracked"` and empty `hook_prompts`. A session selector is echoed as `session_id` without inventing logical `id`. It does not suppress malformed configuration, incompatible schema, or other errors. |
| `--prepare` | Atomically attempt or renew the project claim. Returns `merge_claim.state` as `claimed`, `waiting`, or `not_applicable`. |
| `--heartbeat` | Renew an owned, unexpired claim. Requires `--merge-token`. |
| `--cancel` | Release the still-matching owned claim and restore its latest underlying status. It remains available after lease expiry until takeover replaces the token. Requires `--merge-token`. |
| `--merge-token <token>` | Opaque token returned by a claimed prepare; required for heartbeat, cancel, and non-done commit. |

Preparing or closing an already-done thread is an idempotent no-op with no
prompt. A stale token is fenced. Reopen-then-prepare creates a new claim and
token; the following state-changing close creates a new
transition/finalization pair and surfaces the current `OnPostClose` prompt.

## `append-rollout`

Append one explicit rollout without changing thread status or description.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" append-rollout \
  --id <creation-id> \
  --turn-id compact:<codex-turn-id>:manual \
  --role meta \
  --message "compaction:manual" \
  --json
```

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--id <creation-id>` / `--session-id <session-id>` | Mutually exclusive selector; exactly one is required. |
| `--turn-id <event-id>` | Required non-empty event identity. |
| `--role <role>` | Required: `user`, `assistant`, or `meta`. |
| `--message <text>` | Required event text; normalized before storage. |

For a given thread, role, and turn ID, replaying the same normalized message is
a no-op; replaying a different message is a conflict. The result is the full
thread snapshot.

## `record-turn`

Record a normalized user or assistant turn and project it into current status
without changing the task description.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" record-turn \
  --session-id <session-id> \
  --turn-id <codex-turn-id> \
  --role assistant \
  --content "Implemented and verified the change." \
  --summary "Implemented configurable hooks." \
  --json
```

| Flag | Values and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `--id <creation-id>` / `--session-id <session-id>` | Mutually exclusive selector; exactly one is required. |
| `--role <role>` | Required: `user` or `assistant`. |
| `--turn-id <turn-id>` | Required non-empty Codex turn ID. |
| `--content <text>` | Required turn content. Assistant content beginning exactly with `Blocked:` projects the thread to `blocked`; other nonterminal turns project it to `active`. |
| `--summary <text>` | Optional human-readable summary stored as the rollout message. Without it, the command derives a summary from `content`. For the initial user prompt, it must normalize identically to `content` and the registered description. |

The command reconciles a provisional `turn_id=bootstrap` event with the first
matching real turn when safe. Exact retries are no-ops; different messages for
the same event identity are conflicts. A first user event or any `bootstrap`
user event whose normalized content differs from the registered description is
rejected. Later user and assistant messages are still recorded, and assistant
content still selects `blocked` or `active`, but neither can replace the task
description. A Stop event that wins the race before bootstrap verification
keeps its authoritative status when the matching bootstrap write arrives.
Turns recorded after completion are retained without reopening or changing the
`done` status.

## `hook`

Consume one Codex command-hook payload from standard input. This command has no
flags, does not support `--json`, and is intended for Codex rather than manual
use.

```bash
printf '%s\n' '<codex-hook-json>' | python3 "$AGTASK" hook
```

The payload must identify the event in `hook_event_name` and the tracked thread
in `session_id`. Supported mappings are:

| Codex event | agtask behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` | For `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, or `compact`, print current task context for Codex. This payload does not contain the prompt, so bootstrap arguments are not parsed here. |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Validate an exact final bootstrap envelope and render allowlisted child action context. A valid version-2 prompt atomically binds its logical ID to an untracked real session and records the real user turn under that logical ID; otherwise recording requires a tracked payload session. Description remains stable. Conflicting/copied bindings are silent. |
| `Stop` | Record the final assistant message and update lifecycle status without replacing the description. |
| `PostCompact` | Append `compaction:manual` or `compaction:auto` metadata. |

Missing ledgers and untracked sessions are ignored unless a valid version-2
creation prompt authorizes initialization and self-registration. Malformed payloads, unsafe permissions,
locked databases, and other hook errors are ignored deliberately so the host
Codex event can continue.

Bootstrap handling lets a queued worktree act once its first
`UserPromptSubmit` has a real `session_id`. Version 1 remains action-only and
accepts canonical `pin` and `title`; version 2 additionally requires canonical
UUIDv4 `id`, `parent_session_id`, and `project` values and binds that ID to the
hook session. An exact pair retries idempotently. An ID owned by another session
or a session owned by another ID emits no row, rollout, context, or app action.
Only inside a valid Codex delegation wrapper, the complete transported
`<input>` is entity-decoded exactly once before bootstrap parsing; pre-escaped
literal task text remains literal after the outer transport layer is removed.
Unwrapped prompt text is never HTML-decoded. Version-2 actions
are emitted only after registration and rollout recording commit. `pin=true`
renders an idempotent model-mediated `codex_app__set_thread_pinned` request;
`pin=false` renders no pin action. The required nonempty one-line title renders
an independent idempotent `codex_app__set_thread_title` request and is treated
only as tool data. Unsupported versions, non-final or noncanonical envelopes,
unknown keys, duplicate keys, and wrong types are ignored. The hook never
evaluates JSON, executes commands, or treats unknown keys as behavior.
Nonempty context is returned as structured
`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, matching Codex's command-hook schema.
The recovered trailer must still satisfy final-position and canonical JSON
validation; decoding the transport layer does not relax either contract.

## `install-hooks`

Install agtask's `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, and `PostCompact`
command-hook groups into the Codex hooks file.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" install-hooks --json
```

There are no command-specific flags. The installer preserves unrelated hook
groups and the existing file mode, creates a timestamped backup when changing
an existing file, detects concurrent modification, and replaces the file
atomically. The result reports whether the file changed, its path, and the
required manual trust action: open `/hooks` in the Codex TUI and approve each
agtask handler.

## `uninstall-hooks`

Remove only command-hook groups owned by agtask.

```bash
python3 "$AGTASK" uninstall-hooks --json
```

There are no command-specific flags. Unrelated hook groups and the ledger are
preserved. When the hooks file changes, the command uses the same backup,
concurrent-edit detection, and atomic replacement behavior as `install-hooks`.
The result reports whether the file changed and the hooks file path.
