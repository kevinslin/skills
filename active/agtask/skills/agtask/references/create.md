Default to child kind and start a clean task in the active CWD. Select fork
mode when the user explicitly asks to preserve or continue the current context.
Main kind designates the invoking task itself and never creates another task.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the invoking Codex session ID. Use the authoritative current app
   context; use `$dev.llm-session` when the ID is not already available.
2. Resolve the task text, title, normalized initial-prompt description, topic,
   active CWD, creation mode, kind, and project, then pass the resolved title to
   `resolve-create` for a logical creation ID, deterministic creation inputs,
   and configured `OnCreate` prompt data.
3. For main kind, designate the invoking thread, pin it, register it without
   parent lineage, consume any configured `OnCreate` instruction in the current
   task, and set its title. Do not create, fork, or message another thread.
4. For child kind, create exactly one Codex thread using the resolved worktree
   and model inputs, publish its pending deep link, register it with the
   invoking thread as parent, and submit the task prompt plus configured
   `OnCreate` instruction and the resolver's exact final bootstrap trailer.
5. Let the version-2 `UserPromptSubmit` hook atomically register an untracked
   materialized child and record its real first turn. Keep parent registration
   and the bootstrap record as idempotent fallback/reconciliation writes, then
   validate the available result and repeat the deep link. The child also
   applies title and pin bootstrap actions to itself. When the child runs on a
   remote host and creation returns a real Codex session ID (`threadId` in the
   creation result), additionally apply the same idempotent title and pin
   actions from the parent as a fallback for remote hosts without the agtask
   hook.

## Resolve the request

- Preserve the supplied task's meaning and separate explicit creation
  directives such as mode, worktree, model, reasoning, pin, kind, project, and
  title as execution settings.
- Treat the user's direct ask as the task's scope. Aspirational or background
  language such as "we want to implement" does not authorize implementation
  when the operative ask is to evaluate, explain, compare, recommend, or answer
  a question.
- You may paraphrase, reorganize, and concisely summarize relevant conversation
  context to make the child task self-contained. Resolve references such as
  "what we discussed" when the conversation establishes their meaning.
  Preserve exact identifiers, paths, commands, field names, quoted values, and
  other literals when their spelling is operationally significant.
- Preserve the requested work mode, scope, outcomes, and material constraints.
  Never turn explanation, exploration, planning, review, recommendation, or
  specification work into implementation, and do not invent repository
  changes, tests, documentation work, commits, deployments, or follow-up steps
  that the user did not authorize.
- If separating creation settings and resolving available context still leaves
  materially ambiguous task scope, ask the user before creating the child. Do
  not use ambiguity as permission to broaden authority or mutate.
- Treat explicit `kind=main` as a request to designate the invoking thread as a
  root dispatcher with null parent lineage. Default to `kind=child`; child
  threads carry the invoking thread as immutable parent lineage.
- Preserve an explicit project string. Otherwise use the basename of the active
  task's CWD.
- Build the exact initial prompt before registration. Derive its concise
  one-sentence description with the CLI normalization rules and a 2-5 word
  kebab-case topic. The initial prompt, not later turns, is the sole source of
  the task description.
- Treat the active task's CWD as the authoritative target.

## Naming scheme

- An explicit user title wins unchanged.
- Main kind uses `⭐ <project>`.
- Child kind uses `<parent-title>/<topic>` when the parent title is available,
  or `agtask/<topic>` as the fallback.
- Before composing a child title, remove every leading emoji grapheme and any
  whitespace immediately following each removed grapheme from the parent
  title. Then remove one optional leading ASCII hyphen and its following
  whitespace so legacy parent titles do not leak their separator into child
  names. Preserve emoji and hyphens elsewhere. Do not apply this cleanup to a
  main title; its leading star is intentional. For example, parent title
  `⭐ agtask` plus topic `short-term-fast-path-spec` becomes
  `agtask/short-term-fast-path-spec`; `⭐ 🚀 agtask/topic` becomes
  `agtask/topic`; and `agtask/⭐-topic` is unchanged.

## Normalize creation inputs

Run the bundled resolver once before designation or creation:

```text
python3 ./scripts/agtask resolve-create \
  --mode <clean|fork> \
  --title <resolved-title> \
  [--kind <main|child>] \
  [--project <project>] \
  [--parent-session-id <invoking-session-id>] \
  [--worktree <true|false>] \
  [--model <model-id|inherit>] \
  [--pin <true|false> | --nopin] \
  --json
```

- Translate explicit user settings into the matching resolver arguments and
  omit unspecified settings so the CLI applies its defaults. Treat standalone
  `nopin` as `--nopin`. Remove execution modifiers from the task text.
- Pass the already-derived title through required `--title`; reject an empty,
  surrounding-whitespace, or multiline title. Use the returned `mode`, `kind`,
  `id`, `project`, `title`, `worktree`, `model`, `pin`, `bootstrap_args`,
  `bootstrap_trailer`, `environment`, `include_model`, and `hook_prompts`
  values unchanged throughout the workflow. Ask the user to resolve a rejected
  or contradictory input.
- For main kind, preserve the returned `id` for registration but treat the
  remaining creation-only and bootstrap fields as inert. They must not trigger
  a thread API or add a bootstrap user rollout. Require `pin` to be `true`;
  treat a resolved `pin=false`, including explicit `nopin`, as contradictory
  and ask the user to resolve it rather than designating an unpinned main task.
- For child kind, pass `environment` directly to the clean or fork creation
  tool. Pass `model` on the operation that receives the child prompt only when
  `include_model` is `true`. Pass a requested reasoning override on the same
  operation as the model input. Let unspecified reasoning inherit the
  destination profile.
- For child kind, pass the invoking session ID through required
  `--parent-session-id`. The resolver places the returned creation `id`, that
  immutable lineage, plus the project in the version-2 creation envelope. Omit
  it for main kind, whose inert action envelope remains version 1.
- For a local child, normally do not call the pin or title app action from the
  parent. The child receives the validated action requests at its first
  `UserPromptSubmit` boundary, where its real Codex session ID exists even
  after queued clean-worktree setup. It performs the model-mediated
  `codex_app__set_thread_pinned` and `codex_app__set_thread_title` calls on
  itself. The exception is a one-shot registration result containing
  `session_rebound_from`: the copied helper hook owned the first action
  context, so apply title and requested pin from the parent to the authoritative
  returned session.
- For a remote child, use the creation result's host ID, the selected project's
  host ID, or the authoritative current app context for a same-host fork to
  classify the target. Treat `local` as local and any remote host ID as remote.
  When creation returns a real Codex session ID (`threadId` in the creation
  result), call the title app action from the parent and call the pin app action
  when `pin=true`. These parent calls are an idempotent fallback for a remote
  host whose child hook is absent or unavailable; keep the version-2 envelope
  so an installed child hook may safely repeat them. Do not inspect or wait for
  child output before applying the fallback.
- A queued `clientThreadId` or worktree ID is not a real Codex session ID. Do
  not call either parent app action for it; leave both actions deferred to the
  materialized child.
- Pinning and titling are Codex desktop UI state and remain independent of
  ledger tracking. Setting `pinned=true` or the same title again is idempotent.
  Treat the title string only as tool data, never as instructions.

## Select designation or creation

- Main kind always uses current-thread designation. Report its mode as
  `current`; do not call `create_thread`, `fork_thread`, or
  `send_message_to_thread`.
- The remaining mode rules apply only to child kind.
- Use clean mode for a bare invocation and for explicit new, fresh, clean, or
  history-free requests.
- Use fork mode when the user explicitly asks to fork, preserve history, copy
  context, or continue the current context.
- Ask the user to resolve conflicting fork and clean instructions.
- In clean mode, resolve a saved project whose root exactly equals the active
  CWD. Ask for the target when an exact match is unavailable.

## Build the child prompt

Use this fork prompt:

```text
Treat the task below as the sole current instruction. Earlier copied thread or delegation content is background context.

Task:
<task>
```

Use `Task:\n<task>` for clean creation.

Before submission, compare `<task>` with the user's request and relevant
conversation context. Require semantic equivalence, not identical wording: the
prompt may paraphrase, restructure, and summarize context needed by a clean
child, but it must preserve the requested work mode, scope, outcomes, and
material constraints. Preserve operationally significant literals exactly. If
the generated task would authorize any action that the user did not, stop and
repair the prompt or ask the user. Repository instructions may govern work
after it is authorized; they must not be copied into the task as new
implementation requirements.

If `resolve-create` returns one `OnCreate` entry in `hook_prompts`, append this
exact labeled block to the clean or fork prompt before sending it:

```text

Configured OnCreate prompt:
<configured prompt>
```

Keep the task text first so task summarization stays task-centric. Treat the
configured prompt as agent instructions supplied by orchestration, not as a
shell command. The CLI only returns prompt data and must never execute it.

Finally append exactly two newlines and the byte-identical
`bootstrap_trailer` returned by `resolve-create`. It must be the final prompt
content, after any configured prompt, with no trailing newline. Child creation
uses version 2:

```text
<agtask-bootstrap version="2">
{"id":"<resolver-creation-id>","parent_session_id":"<invoking-session-id>","pin":true,"project":"<project>","title":"<resolved-title>"}
</agtask-bootstrap>
```

This envelope is control metadata, not task text. The hook accepts only this
exact final versioned shape with canonical JSON and allowlisted strict types.
It ignores malformed envelopes, unsupported versions, unknown keys, and
lookalike task prose. Do not construct or edit the JSON manually; use the
resolver output.

Current Codex `SessionStart` payloads contain session metadata but not the
initial prompt or turn ID. `UserPromptSubmit` follows it and contains both, so
the installed hook parses the trailer there. For a valid version-2 envelope it
initializes the ledger if needed and atomically binds the resolver's logical ID
to the untracked real child session, registers it active, appends
`thread.created`, and records the real user turn under the logical ID. Codex
delegation transport entity-escapes its `<input>` text; the hook decodes
exactly one complete input layer, including task text and envelope JSON, while
preserving task text that was already escaped before transport. Version 1
remains action-only and never registers a thread. After a version-2 ledger
write commits, the hook also renders fixed allowlisted action requests through
structured `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. The child model owns the
app calls. It must report `Pin: true (pinned)`,
`Pin: true (unavailable)`, or `Pin: true (failed: <exact error>)`, plus
`Title: set`, `Title: unavailable`, or `Title: failed: <exact error>`, then
continue the task. Setting `pinned=true` or the same title is idempotent, and
hook or app-action failures must never prevent task execution.

The same `(id, session_id)` pair is an idempotent retry. If the ID is already
bound to another session, or the session to another ID, the hook must emit no
row, rollout, tracked context, title action, or pin action. This is how a copied
bootstrap in an internal title-generation session is rejected. Do not treat
the creation ID as a secret or mint a replacement ID during one creation
attempt.

## Designate or create and register

Resolve the bundled CLI as `./scripts/agtask`. Pass dynamic values as
individually shell-quoted arguments.

For the target real Codex session ID, immediately emit one commentary update
before registration. Use `designated` for main kind and `created` for child
kind:

```text
Task: [<title>](codex://threads/<session-id>) — designated; tracking pending
Task: [<title>](codex://threads/<session-id>) — created; tracking pending
```

Do not describe the task as tracked until registration is verified.

### Main designation

1. Use the resolver's `id` as the logical task ID and the invoking session ID as
   the Codex target. Do not call any thread creation, fork, or message API.
2. Publish its `designated; tracking pending` deep link.
3. Apply the resolved pin input to the invoking thread.
4. Run `register --json` with `--id` set to the resolver ID, `--session-id` set
   to the invoking session ID, resolved project and title, the exact invoking
   task prompt as `--initial-prompt`, its normalized value as the optional
   `--description` assertion, `--kind main`, and `--status active`. Omit
   `--parent-session-id`.
5. Validate the registration snapshot and require its `hook_prompts` to equal
   the resolver's pending `OnCreate` data.
6. Consume each returned `OnCreate` prompt as the next agent instruction in the
   current task. Never send it through `send_message_to_thread`, execute it as
   a shell command, or record a synthetic bootstrap user rollout.
7. Attempt title assignment on the invoking thread and return its deep link.

Registration is the main designation proof. Existing conversation history
remains in Codex; subsequent hooks project new rollouts after registration.
Main designation has no child prompt or initial-rollout verification step.

### Child clean mode

Prefer the two-phase clean API when the local Codex surface can start a thread
without starting its first turn:

1. Resolve the exact saved-project match for the active CWD.
2. Start an empty clean thread with the resolved `worktree` environment and
   obtain its real session ID.
3. Publish the pending commentary link.
4. Run `register --json` with the resolver `--id`, the real `--session-id`,
   `--kind child`, resolved project, title, the fully built clean prompt as
   `--initial-prompt`, its normalized value as the optional `--description`
   assertion, `--status todo`, and the invoking `--parent-session-id`. Validate
   the returned registration snapshot. Require `hook_prompts` to equal the
   resolver's pending `OnCreate` data when this call created the row, or to be
   empty when the accepted version-2 hook already created it.
5. Send the fully built clean prompt with the resolved model input to start the
   first turn and deliver the deferred child-owned actions.
6. Run `record-turn --json` with the resolver logical ID, role `user`, turn ID
   `bootstrap`, and the byte-identical prompt as `--content`. Omit `--summary`
   so this write and the `UserPromptSubmit` hook use the same normalizer.
7. Validate the returned initial-rollout snapshot. For a remote child with a
   real Codex session ID, apply the parent-side title and pin fallback, then
   return the final deep link without waiting for child-owned app actions. For
   a local child, keep both actions deferred.

If prompt submission is rejected or fails, do not write the bootstrap user
rollout. The tracked child remains `todo`; report
`tracked; prompt not accepted`. Neither deferred app action runs without an
accepted prompt.

Use the one-shot fallback when the clean API requires the prompt during
creation:

1. Create the clean thread with the fully built clean prompt, the resolved
   `worktree` environment, and the resolved model input; obtain its real session
   ID.
2. Publish the pending commentary link.
3. Run `register --json --authoritative-session` with the resolver `--id`, real
   `--session-id`, `--kind child`, resolved project, title, the fully built
   clean prompt as `--initial-prompt`, its normalized value as the optional
   `--description` assertion, `--status active`, and the invoking
   `--parent-session-id`.
   Validate the returned registration snapshot. The hook may already have
   created the active row and real user rollout; in that case require empty
   `hook_prompts` and preserve its history. If a copied helper session claimed
   the logical ID first, require `session_rebound_from` to name that prior
   session, require the returned `session_id` to equal the `create_thread`
   result, and require only `thread.created` to remain before the bootstrap
   write.
4. Run `record-turn --json` with role `user`, turn ID `bootstrap`, and the
   byte-identical clean prompt as `--content`. Omit `--summary`.
5. Validate the returned initial-rollout snapshot, including any later
   assistant-owned state. For a remote child with a real Codex session ID, or a
   local child whose registration returned `session_rebound_from`, apply the
   parent-side title and pin fallback, then return the final deep link without
   waiting for child-owned app actions. Otherwise keep local actions deferred.

The real user hook and bootstrap fallback reconcile to one rollout when their
normalized summaries match, regardless of arrival order.

### Child fork mode

1. Fork the calling task with the environment mapped from the resolved
   `worktree` input and the prompt field omitted.
2. Publish the pending commentary link.
3. Run `register --json` with the resolver logical ID, real session ID,
   `--kind child`, resolved project, title, the fully built fork prompt as
   `--initial-prompt`, its normalized value as the optional `--description`
   assertion, `--status todo`, and the invoking parent session ID. Validate the
   returned registration snapshot, allowing empty `hook_prompts` when
   version-2 hook registration won the race.
4. Send the fully built fork prompt with the resolved model input to deliver
   the deferred child-owned actions.
5. Run `record-turn --json` with role `user`, turn ID `bootstrap`, and the
   byte-identical fork prompt as `--content`. Omit `--summary`.
6. Validate the returned initial-rollout snapshot. For a remote child with a
   real Codex session ID, apply the parent-side title and pin fallback, then
   return the final deep link without waiting for child-owned app actions. For
   a local child, keep both actions deferred.

If prompt submission is rejected or fails, do not write the bootstrap user
rollout. The tracked child remains `todo`; report
`tracked; prompt not accepted`. Neither deferred app action runs without an
accepted prompt.

If clean creation returns a pending `clientThreadId` instead of a real session
ID, report queued partial success with that ID and end parent-side work at the
queued state. The clean `create_thread` request already contains the version-2
trailer, so the materialized child's first hook binds the resolver ID to its
real session, records the user turn, and renders title/pin actions without
parent polling. Report this path as queued and self-registering rather than
already parent-verified.

If a worktree fork returns `clientThreadId`, report queued partial success and
stop before registration or prompt submission. `fork_thread` carries copied
history but no prompt, and `clientThreadId` is neither a real session ID nor a
valid target for `send_message_to_thread`. Do not describe this path as
self-registering: no version-2 trailer has reached the child. A later workflow
must obtain the real child session ID before it can register the preserved
creation ID and send the fork prompt.

The one-shot path treats the `create_thread` result as authoritative. If a
copied internal session bound the same logical ID first, parent registration
may rebind only through `--authoritative-session`. Rebinding requires the
requested session to be unclaimed, immutable lineage/kind/project/title to
match, and the stored row to have the provisional first-turn rollout shape. It
removes copied user/assistant rollouts, preserves one `thread.created` event,
stores the real prompt description, and reports `session_rebound_from`.
Ordinary registration and hook conflicts remain strict; never infer the
authoritative session from title, timing, or UUID order.

## Verify write results

Validate the JSON returned by `register` without rereading a successful write.
Require:

- the exact resolver logical `id`, real Codex `session_id`, title, and
  description derived from the normalized `--initial-prompt`;
- `kind` and `project` equal to the resolver output;
- for child kind, `parent_session_id` equal to the invoking session ID;
- for main kind, `parent_session_id` equal to `null`;
- the requested `todo` or `active` status;
- one `meta` rollout with `turn_id` and `message` equal to `thread.created`;
- `hook_prompts` exactly equal to the pending `OnCreate` data when `register`
  created the row, or empty when version-2 hook registration already consumed
  the creation boundary. An empty configured prompt always produces an empty
  array.
- for a one-shot copied-session reconciliation, `session_rebound_from` equals
  the displaced helper session, the returned `session_id` equals the
  `create_thread` result, and no copied user or assistant rollout remains.

For child kind, validate the JSON returned by `record-turn` without rereading a
successful write. Require:

- exactly one total initial `user` rollout;
- that rollout's `message` equals the CLI-normalized prompt;
- a thread `description` equal to the CLI-normalized initial prompt, regardless
  of later user or assistant rollouts;
- when no later assistant rollout exists, `active` status;
- when a later assistant rollout exists, an authoritative returned status of
  `active` or `blocked`. Do not recompute that status from the normalized stored
  message because status is derived from the raw assistant content before
  message normalization.

A fast `Stop` hook may commit before bootstrap verification. Its later
assistant-owned status is valid stronger lifecycle state; bootstrap verification
must preserve that status and the original initial-prompt description while
still proving the initial user rollout is unique and correct. A terse final
answer such as `Yes.` is a rollout message, never a replacement description.

### Ambiguous registration result

When `register` returns malformed JSON or its process result is ambiguous, run
one targeted `show --json` error-path read. Continue when that snapshot proves
the registration invariant. Retry `register` once only when the read proves the
target is untracked. Otherwise preserve the target link and report registration
partial with every exact error. Do not retry a definitive validation, lineage,
or compatibility error.

### Ambiguous initial-rollout result

When `record-turn` times out, fails ambiguously, or returns malformed JSON after
prompt acceptance, retry the identical `record-turn` command once. If the
result remains ambiguous, run one targeted `show --json` error-path read.
Return verified only when the snapshot proves the initial-rollout invariant;
otherwise report `tracked; prompt accepted; initial rollout unverified` with
every exact error.

These recovery reads are error-path-only. Normal designation or creation does
not call `read_thread`, reread successful writes, inspect child completion, or
synthesize an assistant rollout. The `Stop` hook owns assistant capture.

Classify the result:

- **Verified:** Report a main task as designated and tracked with initial
  rollout `not applicable`; report a child task as tracked with its parent,
  status, and initial rollout result.
- **Queued:** Report the pending client or worktree ID and queued state.
- **Registration partial:** Preserve the real target link and report the exact
  ledger error with tracking marked unverified.
- **Initial rollout unverified:** Report the child as tracked and prompt
  accepted, but state that its initial rollout could not be proven.

## Output

Return:

- `Mode: current` for main kind, otherwise `Mode: fork` or `Mode: clean`;
- `Worktree: not applicable` for main kind, otherwise `Worktree: true` or
  `Worktree: false`;
- `Model: current (unchanged)` for main kind, otherwise `Model: inherit` or
  `Model: <model-id>`;
- `Kind: child` or `Kind: main`;
- `Project: <project>`;
- `Task: [title](codex://threads/<session-id>)`;
- `Task ID: <logical-creation-id>`;
- `Session ID: <codex-session-id>`;
- `Parent session ID: <invoking-session-id>` for child kind or
  `Parent session ID: none` for main kind;
- `Database: ~/.llm/agtask/ledger.db`;
- for main kind, the direct title result and `Pin: true (pinned)`,
  `Pin: true (unavailable)`, or `Pin: true (failed: <exact error>)`;
- for an ordinary local or queued child, `Title: <resolved-title> (deferred to
  child)` and `Pin: true (deferred to child)` or `Pin: false (skipped)`; the
  child surfaces the eventual app-action results;
- for a local one-shot child whose registration returned
  `session_rebound_from`, report the same direct parent fallback results used
  for a remote child;
- for a remote child with a real Codex session ID, the direct parent fallback
  result: `Title: <resolved-title> (set by parent fallback)`,
  `Title: failed: <exact error>`, or `Title: unavailable`; and
  `Pin: true (pinned by parent fallback)`,
  `Pin: true (failed: <exact error>)`, `Pin: true (unavailable)`, or
  `Pin: false (skipped)`;
- verified status and initial rollout result (`not applicable` for main
  designation).

Return after verification and any real-remote-child parent fallback without
waiting for deferred child title or pin actions. App-action errors are separate
from verified tracking. Monitor child completion only when the user explicitly
requests it. Repeat the deep link in the final response.
