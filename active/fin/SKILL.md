# fin

Use this skill at the end of a task before the final user-facing report.

## Context Selection

Run `fin [context] [target]`.

- `gh`: finalize from a GitHub PR context. Use this when the task should land by merging the current remote PR or when the matching PR already merged and only cleanup/final verification remains. The original `fin` workflow maps to this context.
- `local`: finalize from a local checkout. Use this when the task should land directly from local git state without depending on GitHub PR state.
- `[target]`: optional for `gh` only. Accept a PR number, PR URL, or branch name. Examples: `fin gh 85117`, `fin gh https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/85117`.
- If the current checkout is detached `HEAD`, treat that as a preflight issue, not a valid finalization state. Create a short-lived local branch from the current commit before auto-detecting context, checking mergeability, or attempting worktree cleanup.
- If the argument is `gh` or `local`, respect it throughout the flow. Do not silently switch later just because repo state would make the other path easier.
- If `gh` has an explicit `[target]`, lock that PR target before current-branch detection. Use the target PR as the source of truth for state, mergeability, comments, checks, spec matching, merge, and automation cleanup.
- If the user omits `[target]` but the immediately preceding active heartbeat or delayed-merge instruction names exactly one PR and the user asks to merge, finalize, ignore a waiting period, or ignore a proof gate, treat that PR as an explicit `gh` target after one live PR-state check. Report the target source as `heartbeat automation`.
- If the user omits `[target]` but the immediately preceding task in the same thread completed or repaired exactly one PR, such as after `trigger:fix-pr`, `trigger:fix-pr-conflict`, or a PR-specific babysit/CI run, treat that PR as an explicit `gh` target after one live PR-state check. Report the target source as `active task context`. If the current checkout points at another branch or PR, mention the mismatch and ignore the unrelated checkout for PR state, spec archival, merge, automation, and cleanup decisions unless it blocks local cleanup.
- If an explicit `gh` target does not match the current branch, do not silently fall back to the current branch's PR. Either run the remote-PR finalization path for that explicit target, or stop with a target mismatch before any spec archival, branch cleanup, or merge.
- If the argument is omitted, detect the context from the current branch before any archival or landing work:
  - Choose `gh` when the current branch has an open or already-merged PR that corresponds to the branch being finalized.
  - Choose `local` when the current branch has no matching PR and the work should land directly from local git state.
- Treat heartbeat-derived or active-task-derived PR targets as explicit `gh` targets, not as current-branch auto-detection.
- If the argument is present but not one of `gh` / `local`, stop and ask the user which context to use.
- Report whether the finalization context was explicitly provided or auto-detected.
- Before reporting any PR status or blocker, print one target identity line: `Target: PR #<number>, branch <headRefName>, source=<current checkout|explicit user PR|heartbeat automation|active task context>`. When multiple PRs have been mentioned in the session, prefix every PR-specific state claim with the PR number.

## Shared Workflow

1. Confirm finalization preconditions
- Use this flow only when the requested scope is complete.
- If work is partial or blocked, do not archive specs and do not present the task as finished.
- Before archiving any spec or attempting to land the change, determine the current branch, whether it is attached to a linked worktree, and where the non-worktree `main` checkout lives.
- Check `~/.fin.yaml` for repo-specific finalization instructions before landing or cleanup. If the file exists, parse entries shaped as `workspace: [{path: ..., instructions: ...}]`.
- If `~/.fin.yaml` exists but cannot be parsed, do not treat the parse failure as "no hooks". Report the parser error separately and inspect the raw file. Continue only when the raw content is clearly non-executable, unambiguous context; if it might contain commands, hooks, destructive instructions, or ambiguous cleanup requirements, stop before spec archival, landing cleanup, or linked-worktree removal and report the malformed config as the blocker.
- Match `workspace[].path` against the normalized non-worktree checkout root for the branch's repository, not against a transient linked worktree path. Resolve symlinks and trailing slashes before comparing.
- If a matching `~/.fin.yaml` workspace entry exists, record its `instructions` and apply them after the PR merge / already-merged confirmation or local landing succeeds, but before removing any linked worktree. This preserves ignored or untracked files that may need to be copied out of the soon-to-be-removed worktree.
- Also treat matching `~/.fin.yaml` instructions as routing context for active spec discovery. If the instructions mention a `$specy`, `$mem`, or `.mem` artifact root, derive candidate docs roots from that instruction before falling back to the default docs root.
- If `~/.fin.yaml` is missing or no workspace entry matches the non-worktree checkout root, state that no repo-specific final hooks applied and continue.
- If the checkout is detached `HEAD`, create a temporary local branch from the current commit first. Prefer the repo's normal task-branch prefix when one exists, otherwise use a short `codex/` branch name derived from the task.
- After converting detached `HEAD` into a named branch, lock that branch identity for the rest of the run. Do not continue finalization from anonymous detached state.
- When the user omitted the context, lock the detected context once and use it for the rest of the run. Do not re-detect after archiving or mid-landing.
- When the user provided, or the heartbeat handoff or active task context implied, an explicit PR target, lock that PR number, head branch, and target source once. Do not replace it with the current checkout's PR because the current checkout is different or easier to operate from.
- Do not silently switch contexts after selection. If the user requested `gh`, do not fall back to local-only landing. If the user requested `local`, do not silently land via PR merge just because a PR exists.
- For `gh` without an explicit target, identify the current PR and check its state before testing mergeability or attempting any merge command.
- For `gh` with an explicit target, identify that target PR directly with GitHub before consulting current-branch PR state. If the current checkout points at another PR, report the mismatch in the target identity line and ignore the other PR unless it blocks local cleanup.
- For `gh`, identify any active PR babysit/watch automation for the target PR or branch when automation state is visible. Record its id so it can be updated or deleted after the PR lands.
- If the task includes a requested external notification after green CI, such as Slack or another chat notice, track that notification as a separate finalization gate from PR mergeability and CI. Check notification prerequisites when feasible, such as required local credential files or configured CLIs, and record any missing prerequisite as a notification blocker, not as a CI failure.
- If the target PR is already merged, treat the PR landing precondition as satisfied and skip mergeability repair. Continue with any matching spec archival, worktree cleanup, local `main` refresh, and retrospective.
- For `gh`, when the target PR is still open, confirm it is mergeable against `main` or its base branch.
  - If GraphQL or `gh pr view` reports `UNKNOWN`/indeterminate mergeability while checks and reviews otherwise look green, poll the REST pull-request endpoint once or twice for `mergeable` and `mergeable_state` before invoking conflict repair. Treat REST `mergeable: true` with `mergeable_state: clean` as the mergeability confirmation; treat repeated `null`/unknown as indeterminate and wait or report it.
- For `local`, confirm the current branch is mergeable into local `main`.
- If the `gh` flow is blocked only by base-branch conflicts, run `trigger:fix-pr-conflict` against the locked target PR and let it try to restore a clean merge state.
- If the `gh` flow is blocked by broader PR issues, or conflict repair needs a fuller pass, run `trigger:fix-pr` against the locked target PR.
- If the `local` flow is blocked only by trunk drift, run `trigger:sync-branch` or otherwise rebase the current branch onto the merge target before retrying the check.
- Continue only after mergeability is confirmed or the matching PR is already merged. If repair cannot restore a mergeable state, stop and report the blockage instead of archiving the spec or landing the change.

### Explicit Blocker Override

- When finalization stops on named non-conflict blockers and the user explicitly says to merge or land while ignoring those blockers, treat that response as an auditable override limited to the blockers already reported for the locked target.
- Restate the target identity and the exact waived blockers before proceeding. Do not infer an override from a generic approval, an earlier broad permission, silence, or a request that does not clearly authorize landing.
- An override may waive failing or pending checks, review/proof/approval gates, waiting periods, and incomplete-spec landing gates. It does not waive an unmergeable/conflicting target, a target mismatch, unknown commit identity, dirty-worktree preservation, malformed or failed final hooks, missing repository permission, or post-merge verification and cleanup.
- Keep incomplete specs and milestones active and unarchived. Do not mark them complete merely to satisfy the normal archival-before-landing order. Record the spec exception in the final report.
- In `gh` context, re-confirm `mergeable: true` for the exact PR head, then use a repository-supported administrator or maintainer override merge. If merge commits are disallowed, retry once with the supported squash method. Never use the override to merge a conflicting or indeterminate head.
- Preserve the waived state in the final report: who authorized it, which blockers were ignored, whether an administrator merge was used, and which spec artifacts intentionally remained active.

### PR Automation Lookup

- Resolve a matching babysit/watch automation by exact automation id first, then by the locked PR number and head branch.
- Bound the automation service lookup to one request and at most 30 seconds of waiting. Do not let an unavailable automation service stall finalization indefinitely.
- If the service lookup errors or times out, search `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/automations` for the exact automation id, PR number, or head branch. Treat this as read-only fallback evidence; never delete automation files directly.
- When the fallback finds a persisted automation, retry one service lookup/delete operation using its exact id. If deletion still fails, report automation cleanup as blocked with the id and error.
- When neither the bounded service lookup nor the exact registry search finds a match, report that no matching persisted automation was present and name the evidence used. Distinguish this from a service-only lookup failure.

### Linear Issue Lookup

- Read `~/.agents/profile` directly. Treat the profile as work only when it contains a trimmed, non-comment line exactly equal to `name=work`. For a non-work profile, skip Linear unless the user or current task context explicitly identifies a Linear issue to finish.
- For a work profile, resolve the active Codex thread id from the current app/session context, using `dev.llm-session` when needed. Use the installed `linear:linear` connector skill and its connected Linear tools; do not use `linear-cli` or a browser fallback.
- Let `thread_link` be the exact deep link `codex://threads/<thread-id>`. Search with `list_issues(query=thread_link, assignee="me", includeArchived=true)` first. If that produces no exact match, run one unscoped `list_issues(query=thread_link, includeArchived=true)` search and follow its pagination until exhausted. If the connector cannot exhaust the candidate set, treat lookup as ambiguous instead of guessing.
- Treat search results only as candidates because Linear search is fuzzy. Keep bulk connector payloads out of the transcript: parse them in the tool-composition layer and emit only candidate ids needed for verification. For every candidate whose complete description is unavailable or marked truncated, call `get_issue` before comparison. Retain only issues whose complete description contains `thread_link` exactly, and expose only each exact match's id, team, status, status type, and URL.
- Accept only an exact `thread_link` match or an issue the user explicitly identified as the ticket for this task. Do not infer linkage from a search hit, similar title, branch name, PR number, assignee, or project.
- Treat statuses with type `backlog`, `unstarted`, or `started` as pending. Treat `completed` and `canceled` issues as terminal and leave them unchanged.
- When exactly one linked pending issue exists, lock its issue id and team for the rest of the run. When no linked pending issue exists, record that Linear completion is not applicable and continue.
- When more than one linked pending issue exists, do not update any of them. Record the matching issue ids as a Linear ambiguity blocker and continue landing without guessing.
- If the connector is unavailable, unauthenticated, or the lookup result is ambiguous, do not retry through another client. Record the exact Linear blocker and continue the landing flow; the final report must describe the result as partial finalization if the task lands but its linked pending issue cannot be verified complete.

2. Resolve the active spec
- Build an ordered list of candidate docs roots:
  - First, use `DOCS_ROOT` when it is configured.
  - Next, if the matching `~/.fin.yaml` instructions mention an absolute `.mem` artifact root for `$specy`, `$mem`, or notes, add `<that-root>/main` when the instruction points at `.mem`, or the path itself when it already points at `.mem/main`.
  - Finally, default to `./docs`.
- Only use candidate roots that exist or whose parent exists and is clearly the intended workspace artifact root. Report the selected spec root when a matching spec is found.
- Follow `specy`'s layout rule for each candidate root: active specs live directly under `$DOCS_ROOT/specs/`.
- Only treat files directly under a candidate `$DOCS_ROOT/specs/` as active specs. Ignore files already under `$DOCS_ROOT/specs/.archive/`.
- Also support folder specs when the workspace uses a folder schema such as `specs`: an active spec folder lives directly under a candidate `$DOCS_ROOT/specs/<spec-slug>/`, with optional sidecars such as `milestones/`, `flows/`, `reports/`, `cook/`, `checklist.md`, or `data/`. Treat the folder as the active spec unit.
- If the completed work is a milestone or sidecar inside an active folder spec,
  do not archive the parent folder unless the parent spec itself is complete. If
  sibling milestones remain, record that the milestone landed and leave the
  parent folder spec active.
- If multiple active specs exist across candidate roots, archive only the one that directly matches the completed task and leave unrelated active specs untouched.
- If no active spec exists for this task, state that explicitly and continue.

3. Mark the spec complete and archive it
- Update the active spec so its status clearly reflects completion before moving it. For folder specs, update the folder's `spec.md`.
- For a completed milestone or sidecar inside an otherwise active folder spec,
  mark or report only that milestone as complete when the file has a clear
  status field or checklist. Do not move the parent folder into `.archive/`
  until the whole folder spec is complete.
- Preserve the existing filename for single-file specs and the existing folder name for folder specs.
- Move the completed spec to `$DOCS_ROOT/specs/.archive/`, creating the directory if needed. For folder specs, move the whole folder so sidecars such as `checklist.md` and `data/` stay with the completed spec.
- Follow `specy`'s convention exactly: when a single-file spec is complete, move it to `$DOCS_ROOT/specs/.archive/` and keep the same filename.
- Do not delete completed specs.

### Deterministic Local Cleanup

- Use `$dev.worktrees cleanup-landed` as the only executor for destructive local worktree and local-branch cleanup during `fin`. Do not reproduce its reset, clean, removal, orphan recovery, or branch deletion steps manually.
- Before invoking it:
  1. confirm the PR or local change actually landed;
  2. run every matching `~/.fin.yaml` final hook;
  3. refresh or verify the local base ref and prove it contains the landed commit; and
  4. record the exact target worktree path, branch or detached state, and expected pre-cleanup HEAD.
- Pass the exact full commit OIDs, refreshed local base branch, target identity, and actual merge mode to `$dev.worktrees cleanup-landed`.
- Require its dry run to report `ready` or `noop`, then rerun the exact command in execute mode.
- Treat `blocked`, `partial`, a nonzero exit, identity drift, or failed postconditions as a finalization blocker. Preserve its journal and rerun the exact command after resolving the blocker.
- Require final status `complete` or `noop`, with the target path, worktree registration, and local branch absent and the base still containing the landed commit.

## `gh` Context Workflow

4. Merge the PR
- Before running a merge command, check the target PR state with GitHub. If the PR is already `MERGED`, do not run `trigger:merge-pr`; record the merge commit or merged-at details when available and proceed as an already-landed PR.
- If the PR is not already merged and the target PR belongs to the current branch, run `trigger:merge-pr` immediately after the matching spec has been marked complete and archived.
- If the PR is not already merged and the explicit target PR does not belong to the current branch, use a target-aware remote merge for that PR, such as `gh pr merge <target>`, after the matching spec has been marked complete and archived. Do not use current-branch merge shortcuts for a different PR.
- Under an explicit blocker override, skip the archival prerequisite only for incomplete matching specs, leave them active, and use the target-aware override merge defined above.
- Treat the merge as part of finalization, not a follow-up option.
- If direct merge is rejected because repository policy requires auto-merge, and checks/reviews are otherwise green, enable repository-supported auto-merge for the locked target PR instead of treating the rejection as a terminal merge failure.
- After any successful auto-merge enablement, query the target PR for `autoMergeRequest`, `state`, `mergedAt`, `mergeCommit`, `mergeStateStatus`, and status checks.
- Treat `autoMergeRequest` present with the PR still `OPEN` as `auto-merge pending`, not as `blocked`, while checks remain green and no explicit cancellation or failing required check is present.
- Poll the locked PR for a bounded window after enabling auto-merge. If it becomes `MERGED`, continue with normal post-merge cleanup. If the bounded window expires with `autoMergeRequest` still present, report `auto-merge pending` with the PR URL and defer local branch/worktree cleanup that requires landed-merge proof.
- Treat auto-merge as blocked only when GitHub reports the auto-merge request was removed/cancelled, a required check fails, conflicts appear, or the PR is otherwise no longer mergeable.
- If the merge command reports that the local branch cannot be deleted because it is still attached to a linked worktree, check whether the remote PR actually merged before treating the step as failed.
- When the PR merged remotely but local branch deletion failed only because of the linked worktree attachment, treat that as a successful merge followed by incomplete cleanup and continue with the deterministic cleanup script from a retained checkout.
- If there is no matching PR to merge, state that explicitly instead of claiming the task fully landed.
- For an explicit target PR that is not checked out locally, skip local branch/worktree cleanup unless the target branch is present in a local worktree or the user explicitly requested cleanup. It is acceptable to merge the remote PR, refresh local `main`, delete matching automation, and report that no local target checkout cleanup was applicable.

5. Refresh and verify the local base ref
- Before destructive cleanup, run any matching repo-specific final hooks from `~/.fin.yaml`. If a hook fails, stop and preserve the worktree and branch.
- After the PR merges, or after confirming it was already merged, update the local base ref before cleanup. Run this refresh from a retained checkout, never from the soon-to-be-removed worktree.
- If the target PR was explicit, heartbeat-derived, or active-task-derived and the non-worktree checkout is on an unrelated active branch, prefer a non-switching base-ref refresh before checking out `main`: run `git fetch <remote> <base>:<base>` only when `<base>` is not checked out in any worktree, then confirm containment with `git merge-base --is-ancestor <mergeCommit> <base>`.
- If the non-switching base-ref refresh is rejected because `<base>` is checked out elsewhere or the ref cannot fast-forward, fall back to the normal checkout-and-pull path when that is safe. Otherwise, stop with a local-main refresh blocker.
- Do not use the non-switching base-ref refresh for `local` landing flows that need to merge the completed local branch into `main`.
- Check out `main` if needed and if the non-switching base-ref refresh path was not used.
- For the normal checkout path, pull or otherwise fast-forward `main` to `origin/main`.
- Confirm the local `main` HEAD, or the refreshed local base ref when the non-switching path was used, contains the PR merge commit before any local worktree or branch deletion.
- Delete or cancel any active PR babysit/watch automation that was tracking the now-merged PR. If the automation cannot be deleted, report the exact blocker instead of leaving silent stale state behind.
- If local base refresh fails because the retained checkout has unrelated dirty changes, use the non-switching path when safe. Otherwise stop before cleanup and report a partial terminal state: PR landed, worktree and local branch preserved, automation cleanup completed if safe, and local base not verified.
- If the local `main` refresh fails for any other reason, stop and report the exact git error instead of claiming the task is fully finalized.

6. Run deterministic local cleanup
- If the PR head branch has a linked worktree, invoke `$dev.worktrees cleanup-landed` with that exact path, PR head branch, PR head SHA, refreshed base ref, merge commit, and actual merge mode.
- If the local PR branch exists but is checked out nowhere, invoke `$dev.worktrees cleanup-landed` in branch-only mode with the same branch/head/base/landing proof.
- If an explicit target PR has no matching local worktree or local branch, report that local cleanup is not applicable; do not manufacture a path or delete a similarly named branch.
- If `gh pr merge --delete-branch` already removed the remote branch but could not remove a linked local branch, do not retry the merge. The cleanup script owns the remaining local transaction.
- Remote branch verification or deletion remains a separate GitHub/Git transport step. Do not add network mutations to the local cleanup script.

## `local` Context Workflow

4. Land the change from the local checkout
- Do not require a GitHub PR for this flow.
- Before merging, make sure the current branch is committed and clean. If it is not, use `trigger:commit-code` first.
- Perform the landing merge from the non-worktree `main` checkout when possible, not from an attached feature worktree.
- Fetch and reconcile `main` before merging when the repo has a remote, but do not discard the completed work while doing so.
- Merge the completed branch into local `main`. Use a non-fast-forward merge unless the user explicitly requested a different merge style.
- If the completed work is already on `main`, do not fabricate a merge commit; instead verify that `main` already contains the intended change set and continue.
- If a remote is configured and pushing `main` is appropriate for the repo, push the updated `main` after the local merge. If the flow is intentionally local-only, state that explicitly in the report.

5. Verify the local base and run final hooks
- After the local merge succeeds, confirm the local base points at the landed result before destructive cleanup.
- Check out `main` if needed.
- Confirm the local `main` HEAD includes the merge commit or direct commit that landed the completed work.
- If the flow included pushing `main`, confirm the pushed remote ref contains the landed commit too.
- Run any matching repo-specific final hooks from `~/.fin.yaml`. If verification or a hook fails, preserve the worktree and branch and report the exact blocker.

6. Run deterministic local cleanup
- If the completed branch has a linked worktree, invoke `$dev.worktrees cleanup-landed` with its exact path, branch, recorded head, local base ref, landed commit, and actual merge mode.
- If the completed local branch exists but is checked out nowhere, invoke `$dev.worktrees cleanup-landed` in branch-only mode.
- The script deletes only the proven local branch. If a corresponding remote branch still exists and repository policy permits cleanup, delete it separately only after local base verification and successful local cleanup.
- If neither a matching linked worktree nor local branch exists, require a cleanup dry run to report `noop` or state that no local cleanup was applicable.

## Linear Completion

7. Complete the linked Linear issue
- Run this step only after the selected landing flow and its required local `main` refresh or verification have completed. Do not complete the issue while a PR is merely auto-merge pending or while finalization is in a partial local-cleanup state.
- If the user explicitly instructed that the linked issue remain open, preserve it and report that override.
- For the single locked pending issue, list the issue team's current statuses through the Linear connector and resolve a status whose type is `completed` live. Prefer the case-insensitive name `Done` when multiple completed statuses exist; if no unique destination can be resolved, leave the issue unchanged and report the ambiguity.
- Update the locked issue to the resolved completed status, then read it back and verify the issue id, team, and status type `completed` before claiming success.
- If the update result is ambiguous, read the locked issue once before retrying. Never create an issue during `fin`, never complete an issue that was not locked during lookup, and never bulk-complete multiple matches.
- If no linked pending issue was found, state that no Linear update was needed. If a linked issue was already completed or canceled, state that it was terminal and unchanged.
- If lookup, status resolution, update, or read-back verification fails, preserve the successful landing result but report `partial finalization: Linear issue not verified complete` with the issue id when known and the exact blocker.

## Retrospective And Reporting

8. Run the retrospective
- Run `$ag-learn` after the task lands in the requested context, after any matching spec has been archived, and after any matching repo-specific final hooks from `~/.fin.yaml` have completed.
- For `gh`, run it after the PR merge or already-merged confirmation, repo-specific final hooks, local base containment proof, and deterministic cleanup complete when applicable.
- For `local`, run it after the local merge, repo-specific final hooks, local base verification, and deterministic cleanup complete when applicable.
- Review the saved learning note and extract 2-3 high-signal learnings.
- Present these as proposed learnings for follow-up, not mandatory extra scope.
- If `ag-learn` finds no meaningful improvement opportunities, say that explicitly.

9. Report the finished state
- State which context ran: `gh` or `local`.
- State whether that context was explicitly requested, implied by heartbeat or active task context, or auto-detected from current-branch PR state.
- For `gh`, state the target identity line with PR number, branch, and source before reporting mergeability, checks, blockers, merge, or cleanup. If another PR was also present in the current checkout, explicitly state that it was not the finalization target.
- State whether the mergeability check passed directly, was skipped because the PR was already merged, or required `fix-pr-conflict` / `fix-pr` / `sync-branch` / manual repair.
- State whether a spec was archived and include the source and destination paths when applicable.
- If an explicit blocker override was used, state the authorizing user instruction, the exact waived blockers, the override merge method, and every incomplete spec or milestone intentionally left active.
- For `gh`, state whether the PR was already merged and `merge-pr` was skipped, or whether `merge-pr` ran successfully, including whether the remote merge succeeded directly or required separate post-merge worktree cleanup because local branch deletion failed.
- For `gh`, if auto-merge was enabled but the PR has not merged yet, report `auto-merge pending`, include the PR URL, head SHA, auto-merge method, `autoMergeRequest.enabledAt` when available, and explicitly state that local cleanup requiring merged proof was deferred.
- For `local`, state whether the branch landed via local merge, was already on `main`, or was blocked before landing.
- State the deterministic cleanup script's final `status`, whether the worktree path and registration are absent, whether the local branch was deleted, and whether cleanup was not applicable. Do not claim or report global prune as a normal step.
- For `gh`, state whether any PR babysit/watch automation was found and whether it was deleted, already absent, or blocked.
- If branch deletion required squash/rebase merge proof, state the PR head SHA, merge commit, and local `main` containment check used as the cleanup proof.
- State whether the local `main` checkout or base ref was updated or verified successfully, identify the resulting `main` tip when relevant, and say whether the normal checkout path or non-switching base-ref path was used.
- State any requested external notification result separately from CI and merge state. If notification delivery is blocked by missing credentials, unavailable CLIs, or channel configuration, say that directly without describing the PR as not green.
- If the remote PR landed but local `main` refresh was blocked by unrelated dirty changes, call that out as `partial local cleanup`: include the merge commit, the dirty-main error, which cleanup steps did complete, and which local branch or verification step was intentionally deferred.
- State whether `~/.fin.yaml` was checked, whether it parsed successfully, whether a workspace entry matched the non-worktree checkout root, and whether the matched repo-specific final hooks completed or were skipped.
- If `local` pushed `main`, state whether the push succeeded. If it intentionally remained local-only, say that explicitly.
- State the Linear result: linked issue id and completed status, no linked pending issue, already-terminal issue left unchanged, explicit keep-open override, or the exact partial-finalization blocker.
- Summarize the proposed learnings as a numbered list so each item can be referenced later.
- Mention where `ag-learn` saved the learning note.
- Keep the final report internally consistent with the chosen context: completed task, completed spec archival, requested landing path, reconciled or verified `main`, completed retrospective.

## Guardrails

- Do not move a spec into `.archive` unless the task is actually complete.
- Do not archive unrelated active specs.
- Do not try to finalize directly from detached `HEAD`; create a named branch first.
- Do not archive a spec or land the change before the current branch or PR is confirmed mergeable for the chosen context, unless the matching PR is already merged.
- Do not silently switch from `gh` to `local` or from `local` to `gh`.
- Do not ask the user to choose `gh` vs `local` when the argument is omitted and branch PR state clearly determines the context.
- Do not choose `gh` from a no-argument invocation unless the PR belongs to the current branch being finalized, or a heartbeat-derived or active-task-derived PR target has been locked after live PR verification.
- Do not run `trigger:merge-pr` when GitHub reports the matching PR is already `MERGED`; use the existing merged state and continue finalization from there.
- If `gh` repair via `fix-pr-conflict` or `fix-pr` cannot restore a mergeable state, stop and report the blockage instead of continuing the finalization flow.
- If `local` repair via branch sync or rebase cannot restore a mergeable state, stop and report the blockage instead of continuing the finalization flow.
- Do not run `merge-pr` in `gh` mode before the matching spec is marked complete and archived, unless an explicit blocker override authorizes landing a mergeable PR while leaving that incomplete spec active and unarchived.
- Do not require a PR in `local` mode.
- Do not classify a green PR as terminally blocked only because GitHub still reports `OPEN`/`BLOCKED` shortly after auto-merge was successfully enabled. Use the explicit `auto-merge pending` state unless the auto-merge request disappears, checks fail, or conflicts appear.
- Do not treat `gh pr merge --delete-branch` local branch-deletion failures caused only by linked worktree attachment as a failed merge when the remote PR already landed.
- Do not leave a merged linked worktree behind when the branch is meant to be fully finalized.
- Do not remove unrelated named worktrees or branches during cleanup. The cleanup script requires the exact registered branch and HEAD, or an explicit detached flag plus exact HEAD; path naming alone is never cleanup authority.
- Do not leave a PR babysit/watch automation active after its PR has merged. Delete or cancel it during finalization, and report any deletion blocker.
- Do not force-delete a squash/rebase-merged local branch based only on GitHub PR state. Refresh the local base first and pass the exact contained landed commit, expected branch head, and `squash` or `rebase` mode to the cleanup script.
- If the local base cannot be refreshed safely because the retained checkout has unrelated changes, preserve the worktree and branch. Do not run cleanup until base containment succeeds.
- Do not run the cleanup script with `--execute` before every matching repo-specific final hook succeeds.
- Do not manually run reset, clean, worktree removal, recursive path deletion, local branch deletion, or global worktree prune as a substitute for the cleanup script.
- Do not delete or rewrite a cleanup journal. When a transaction stops in `blocked` or `partial`, preserve it and rerun the exact command after resolving the reported blocker.
- Do not add remote branch deletion or any other network mutation to the local cleanup script.
- Do not match `~/.fin.yaml` workspace paths against temporary linked worktree roots; match the non-worktree checkout root for the branch's repository.
- Do not ignore a matching `~/.fin.yaml` workspace entry. If the additional instructions are ambiguous, destructive, or cannot be verified, stop and report the blocker before cleanup.
- Do not silently ignore malformed `~/.fin.yaml`; a parse failure is a finalization preflight issue unless raw content is clearly non-executable and unambiguous. Never delete a linked worktree while malformed fin config might contain unrun hooks or cleanup instructions.
- Do not invoke cleanup from inside the target worktree. Pass a retained checkout through `--repo`; the script enforces this boundary.
- Do not report final success while local `main` or the safely refreshed local base ref still points behind the landed result unless the user explicitly says not to refresh or verify it.
- Do not reclassify a green PR or passing CI as blocked because a Slack/chat/desktop notification could not be sent. Report notification failures as auxiliary notification blockers with the missing prerequisite.
- Do not complete a Linear issue before landing and local-main verification succeed, from title/branch/PR similarity alone, or when more than one pending issue matches the active thread.
- Do not claim full finalization when a linked pending Linear issue was found but could not be verified in a completed state. Preserve the landing result and report partial finalization instead.
- Do not invent a parallel spec layout; use the `specy` convention already present in the workspace.
- Do not archive an active parent folder spec just because a milestone sidecar
  inside it landed; leave the parent active while sibling milestones remain.
- Do not archive only `spec.md` when the active spec uses a folder schema. Move the entire spec folder so checklist, data, and other sidecars remain attached.
- Do not suppress `ag-learn` output just because the task was straightforward; run it and report either the proposals or the explicit no-learning result.

## Done Checklist

- `fin` was run with either an explicit `gh` / `local` argument, a heartbeat-derived or active-task-derived PR target, or no argument and a context auto-detected from current-branch PR state.
- In `gh` mode, any explicit PR number, PR URL, branch target, heartbeat-derived PR target, or active-task-derived PR target was locked before current-branch PR detection and reused for every PR-state, mergeability, merge, automation, and cleanup decision.
- Every PR status or blocker report included a target identity line with PR number, branch, and source; when multiple PRs were mentioned, every PR-specific claim was labeled with the PR number.
- If the run started from detached `HEAD`, it was converted into a named branch before context detection and landing.
- The chosen or detected context was locked once and respected throughout the flow.
- Current branch or PR was checked for mergeability against `main` or its base branch before spec archival, unless the matching PR was already merged; any detected conflicts were handled with `trigger:fix-pr-conflict`, `trigger:fix-pr`, `trigger:sync-branch`, or an equivalent local repair flow.
- Matching active spec, if any, is marked complete and moved to
  `$DOCS_ROOT/specs/.archive/`; folder specs were moved as whole folders only
  when the parent spec was complete, and milestone or sidecar completions inside
  still-active parent specs were recorded without archiving the parent.
- Unrelated active specs remain untouched.
- `~/.fin.yaml` was checked, parsed or explicitly handled as malformed, and any workspace entry matching the non-worktree checkout root was applied before linked-worktree removal.
- In `gh` mode, the matching PR was checked for an existing `MERGED` state before attempting merge; `trigger:merge-pr` has been run after archival only when the PR was not already merged, or the missing-PR condition was reported explicitly.
- Any explicit blocker override recorded the locked target, exact waived blockers, authorizing user instruction, override merge method, and intentionally unarchived incomplete specs.
- In `local` mode, the completed branch has been merged into local `main` or verified as already landed there.
- The local base was refreshed or verified to contain the landed commit before cleanup, and every matching final hook succeeded.
- When local cleanup was applicable, the deterministic cleanup script's dry run returned `ready` or `noop`; its execution returned `complete` or `noop` with path, registration, and local branch absent plus base-containment proof true. No global worktree prune was run, and unrelated worktrees and branches were left untouched.
- Any PR babysit/watch automation found for the merged PR was deleted or reported as blocked; service timeouts used the exact read-only registry fallback and did not silently imply absence.
- Requested external notifications, if any, were attempted or explicitly skipped with a separate notification blocker; notification failures were not described as CI failures.
- For squash/rebase-merged PRs, local branch deletion used verified PR merge state plus local `main` containing the PR merge commit, not branch ancestry alone.
- The local `main` checkout was checked for concurrent tracked or untracked changes immediately before refresh, then refreshed or verified to include the landed work before the task was reported complete; otherwise the required partial local cleanup state was reported.
- The active thread's linked Linear issue was checked when applicable; exactly one pending match was moved to a live-resolved completed status and read back successfully, or the no-op/terminal/override/blocker result was reported explicitly.
- `$ag-learn` has been run.
- The final report states whether the context was explicit, implied by heartbeat or active task context, or auto-detected.
- The final report includes the archived spec path change when applicable.
- The final report states the landing result for the chosen context.
- The final report states the local `main` refresh or verification result.
- The final report includes proposed learnings and the saved learning-note path.
